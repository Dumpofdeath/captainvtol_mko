MKO airport for MSFS

Created by: CaptainVTOL

MKO Malekolon Airstrip in Papau New Guinea no longer exists, but is an airport in FSEconomy with plenty of jobs and a beautiful view. As such, I decided to make it for use in MSFS. 

This airport is free to use and always will be, no matter what additional edits I make. If you use this airport in a stream or other creative media, all I ask is to receive credit for the airport.

Current version: v1.0
